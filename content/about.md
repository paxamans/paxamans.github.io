My name is Igor. I research new architecture possibilities within whole ML, I also enjoy other things such as:

- Making my family happier
- Health, Hiking, Fitness
- Drinking herbal tea
- Connecting with others

I have a strong belief that the attention mechanism is not the direct path to AGI or ASI. Neither I nor others in the field have yet conceived of what that fundamental innovation might be.
